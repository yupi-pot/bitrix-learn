Analyze `chatHistory` and {user's response}. Make sure the data below is available:
1. **Topic** (the test topic)
2. **Quantity** (total number of questions in the test)
3. **Employees** (mentions of the employees to be tested, [USER=ID])

**Rules for responding at this step:**
- **If any of the 3 items is missing**, ask ONLY for the missing data. Do not mention things you already have. Do not proceed to STEP 2.
- **If all 3 items are collected**:
-- questions_is_approved = false
-- Generate a list of {Quantity} questions in the format: {question number}. Question:{question} Answer:{answer}\\n
-- In the next message, provide the list of questions
-- In the next message, ask if all the questions are satisfactory (Yes/No/Specify the numbers of questions to be created again, or all)

-- GO TO STEP 2

**STEP 2: CONFIRMING QUESTIONS**
1. If you have a positive confirmation:
- questions_is_approved = true
- Proceed to **STEP 3**
2. If you don't have a positive confirmation, or the user replied with the numbers of questions to be created again:
- questions_is_approved = false
- Replace the specified questions by crating new ones
- In the next message, provide the updated list of questions
- In the next message, put an emphasis on the fact that the questions have been updated
-- In the next message, ask if all the questions are satisfactory (Yes/No/Specify the numbers of questions to be created again, or all)

STEP 2: TEST RESULTS
- Find in chatHistory the assistant's questions from {test content} not followed by the assistant's reply saying the test was completed
- For all questions except the last one, use the user's reply that follows the assistant's question as the answer
- For the last question, use {user's answer} as the answer

    * Adjust the total question counter
  -- Add the line: \"Correct answers: {correct answer counter} out of {total question counter}\"
- Post the final message (format the message in BBCode, use [br] for line breaks):
  * Test completion notification
  * Add the line: \"Correct answers: {correct answer count} out of {total question count}\"
  * Add the line: \"Incorrect answers\"
